PROS: The concept is pretty solid. Requiring girls to message first means less time wasted for everyone. I've had more dates and higher quality matches on here than any other app. Also, the app is pretty good about presenting you with people who've like your profile at the front of the list. CONS: Switching between wifi and cellular data, the app tends to give you false "New Message" notifications. Probably pushing old notifications. Very annoying.
