I enjoy it! Its quick efficient and fun. Happy with it:) but I just wish bumble had an option for people who CANT have kids. I like kids and want them but due to health reasons I can't have them and don't qualify for adoption because of my health reasons. other than that I enjoy the app and had some successful fun dates:)!
