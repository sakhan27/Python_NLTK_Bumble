Please ditch the gesture control for backtracking and add a normal button or swipe. It ruins the flow of using the app and messes with my phone's other gesture controls so the torch keeps turning on and the camera app keeps opening. Also please stop reminding me every 3 swipes that backtrack is a thing and how to do it. Very annoying. One thing I like though is the swiping up and down to look at pictures, makes it very smooth and quick to browse a profile and then like/dislike without having to tap.
