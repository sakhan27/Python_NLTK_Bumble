While its free, its not free. In order to see who liked you, you gotta pay $. In order to 'for real' be seen, you gotta pay $. On top of that if you really want to connect with someone and have them see you, you gotta pay $. And through it all, you half to hope that the persons you are interested in are paying $ to so they can see you. Truth be told, this app sucks cause basically you need to pay and nobody ever responds or likes you regardless paying $ and what bumble says.
