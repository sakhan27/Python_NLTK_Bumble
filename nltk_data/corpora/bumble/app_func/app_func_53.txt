So....am I understanding this right? I can't see who has matched with me unless I pay...and I have to see who matched with me to send a message so...I have to pay in order to make this useful although you say it's free. Then, on top of that, it seems like a guy doesn't really have to pay as long as he can see the messages sent. Hmmmmm. Something doesn't feel right here. Am I using the app wrong?
