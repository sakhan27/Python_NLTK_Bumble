This seemed like a good app but I'm very disappointed in the fact you to pay quite an expensive monthly premium just to see your matches. I'm using the BFF mode and i don't think it's right to take advantage of lonely people who just want to make friends and making them pay for the privilege. I understand you need to make money but atleast don't make it so pricey! I think many others including myself would be more willing to pay a one off cost
