I love the fact that women have to initiate the conversation. However, once both people have liked each other, the app only gives her just ONE DAY to send an intro message (which you can extend once IF you remember). If she forgets, or more likely doesn't see the notification, you're unmatched. The developers say it's to only encourage "serious" matches. Really, it's so they can turn around and charge you a ton to rematch and try again. Stop being so greedy and at least allow a few days!
