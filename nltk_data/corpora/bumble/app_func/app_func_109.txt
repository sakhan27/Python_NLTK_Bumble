I like the app. Simple and easy to use. The push notifications aren't obnoxious and I like the inspirational messages they send throughout the day as well. I wish that the 24 he policy was more lenient. As a busy lady, I may swipe right on someone one day and honestly not have time to chat with them until well into the next. I've lost a few matches that wish I could have kept.
