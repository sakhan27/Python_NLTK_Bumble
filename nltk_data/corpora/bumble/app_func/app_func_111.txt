This app is good. I am a busy man and don't have time to get on the app most days. Only down fall is, when a connection us made. I don't think 24hrs is enough time for people to make that connection. Should be reset from 24 to 72 hours to give people enough time to connect. Other then That, this app by far has best looking people. Your app still sucks. 24 hrs and everything. You all must have alot of time. Can only use the give a 24hrs button 1 time only. Anyways. You dont seem to listen to customers. Read your reviews better.
