A woman's perspective of the Bumble app: it has gotten more specific in how you are able to report aggressive or rude messages, but that being said, it still doesn't seem like much is being done for follow through. Men that use the messaging feature to show aggressive and chauvinistic behavior go unchecked even after being reported. The fact that women get to initiate the conversation changes nothing - and having to navigate though the muck is exhausting. I don't recommend this app.
