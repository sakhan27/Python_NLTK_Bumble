Really @Bumble? You only removed the political feature for those guys after they were brought to your attention by women protecting our democracy. Then, you protected the insurrectionists by removing the political filter instead of taking up the mantle and working to find and report these guys? Also, a filter for race needs to be added because I'm black and I'm not looking for racist white men. Yes, love is blind but it's not stupid.
