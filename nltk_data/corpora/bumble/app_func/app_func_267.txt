Premium users, whatever you call it in app - shouldn't be forced to make a decision on people in the "Beeline" they should wait there until the user is ready to review their profile. Update July 2021: nothing has changed in respect to how this feature operates for premium users. How is this not in your product backlog? It's a no brainer. Update: No! I can't contact you, I don't f with either of those products you want me to use. Odd to assume those are common channels for anything of value.
