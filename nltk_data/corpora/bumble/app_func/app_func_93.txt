Uninstalling. Already think they do a terrible job dealing with fake 
 profiles, but they've crossed the line for me. Saw that they have come out 
 anti-gun. Want all pictures that include guns to be removed. I would think 
 an app catered towards women would be the opposite and be happy to see it's 
 female users with guns, instead for "everyone's protection" they want the 
 pictures gone. People need to stop being afraid of guns and be afraid of 
 criminals instead, but I disgress.
