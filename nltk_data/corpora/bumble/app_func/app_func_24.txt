Bumble, what the heck? This is a nice app! The UI is sleek and functional and I like the whole idea of women messaging first, but, and this a huge BUT, there's this bug that I just encounter and it just killed it for me. I was messaging this girl and she we ended up deciding to watch Bob Ross together, before I could ask her when and where the app decided I couldn't message her, as in I couldn't click on the text box, so I decided to close the app. I opened it up and all of my chats were gone!
