I like the app and the platform, but I really don't like the backend limiting on swiping. I keep reaching the "That's everyone!" page, have to wait an hour or two to refresh, and then I'm able to swipe through more people (4-6 max). There are more people each time and not even new profiles, so it's a bit annoying. As others have said the odds of a match on this app seem slim compared to others, though maybe more quality. I've had two over 2 years of on and off use. Edit: Don't have Twitter/FB
