It's glorified breadcrumbing...I've tried this app twice, once for dating and the second time for friendship. People never want to meet. It's just a message here or there. Conversation have zero depth which makes me wonder if this company uses bots. I think it would be better if Bumble allowed men and women to message after matching. Also think coed friendship should be an option.
