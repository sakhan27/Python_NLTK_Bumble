The new update removed distance - are they 5 km away or 75 km away? Who knows! Not like this was a critical feature or anything ðŸ¥´ please fix this and I'll remove the review. Also, I'm a fully paid user why are you putting non removable ad tracking in the app...? If I'm paid I shouldn't have adware tracking me.
