I am not happy with the way this app works. It's all similar to other dating apps u pay then things go ahead. At least u cud consider ppl using ur app 4 a set no of months and then shower permission to get likes or get things going. Little depressed to know that most of the good stuff u cuz offer, u r asking to pay. It adds on to depression if u ask any1 who has had a bad experience in life and this was a gateway for me but made me more sad. Thanks 4 giving little hope in the Beginning though.
