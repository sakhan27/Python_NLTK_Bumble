The app is pretty useless without the subscription. It's not worth spending money on, just buy flowers for a girl in real life. The features besides dating are alright, but let's be honest, that is not why y'all are here. If you're looking for a dating app, just use Facebook, you'll make better connections thay way. Dating connections on this app are almost impossible to make without paying for a subscription. Don't fall for it.
