Just saw they are banning photos with firearms in them to help people feel safe. Very disappointed. Stupid decision that does absolutely nothing but anger gun owners. Instant 1 star rating. Will not use again. Update. Just saw that they took out a full page ad in the Wall Street Journal in support of the unsubstantiated accusations leveled against Judge Kavanaugh. If I could give this sjw sorry excuse of a dating app 0 stars I would. Supporting accusations like this without any eveidence other than "trust me it happened" is a terrible thing. If you are a man, do not use this app. Who knows what may happen to you in 40 years if you do.
