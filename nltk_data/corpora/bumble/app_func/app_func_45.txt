Overall it's a quality app. Doesn't sync well between Apple and Android switching between the two will show you matches you've already gone through. Would like to see a optional toggle sub menu in description. Main description short and sweet. Submen could be more lengthy for those interested. Also would like to have seven photographs and an added filter telling those who are unverified. Verified user won't respond until they are. Most importantly the syncing issue.
