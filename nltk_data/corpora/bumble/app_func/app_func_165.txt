I used to love bumble but after I signed up for the paid membership they started to throttle/show a shorter list of matches. Also the price of the super likes went up, I compared the price with another friend and mine was 7.99 while his was 4.99 for 2 super likes. It seems once you're willing to pay, bumble tries to milk you at every corner. This used to be my favorite dating app, now I regret paying for the lifetime membership ðŸ˜•
