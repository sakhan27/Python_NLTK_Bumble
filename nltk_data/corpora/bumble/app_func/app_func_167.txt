Aeyyy, your new user interface sucks. The scroll down was much better. This feels like tinder. The about me section comes in late, so seems like rejection rates would go up, I don't know the reality of it tho. Tapping to see pictures of people is more exhausting. And the accident swipe because of your stupid tapping.
