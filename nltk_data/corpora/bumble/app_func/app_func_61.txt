Technically functions well, but as a dating app it's useless even with the paid membership. Haven't had a match in 2 months. 1 date out of 4 conversations in 2 years. App works on current location, not hometown, so I see people who live in Canada, because they are visiting London, and that's not very helpful. If you live in London, like dogs and being outdoors, this is the app for you, as that describes 95% of the users I see. Jesus I miss the days of Okcupid, when people wanted to connect.
