EDIT: I have no problem with limiting swipes, but when they first began limiting, the count of swipes you had was TERRIBLE. They seem to have updated the number you get, which is significantly more than before, and I do believe they shrunk the time after the swipe limit is reached, which is also good. Excellent update.
