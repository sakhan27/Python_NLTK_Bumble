Used to be able to use 2 filters to better navigate potential matches, then pay extra to use more than 2 filters and the other premium features. They recently changed that so you can't use any filters unless you pay extra, literally the only thing that separated them from other sites. Extremely disappointing, it really was good before, but wouldn't recommend to anyone now. Update: April 3rd, they still hide their features behind a pay wall. Cannot recommend, don't waste your time.
