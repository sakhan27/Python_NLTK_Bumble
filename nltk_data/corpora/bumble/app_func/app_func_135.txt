The Bumble coins are TOO easy to accidentally spend. Theres no verification before you start Spotlight or Super Swipe, so if you accidentally click on one or try to see what it is, your coins get spent. I've wasted 3 coins so far - not a lot of money, but I dont like spending money so easily on accident.
