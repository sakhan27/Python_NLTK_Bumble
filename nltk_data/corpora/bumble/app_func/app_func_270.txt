Let's me swipe 4 people. Doesn't matter when I turn the app on or what my filters are set to, get to swipe a few times and then "I've hit the end of the road today!". Even tinder gives you 25 swipes twice a day. Timed resets. This is a waste of space. Further I can speak to any of my matches, so they all just time out because there's very few active users.
