App is well designed with a solid UI/UX. As a dating platform, it sucks: - it's one giant honey trap - tons of apparently fake Insta-like profiles (most women's profiles/pics are unverified) - tons of dead-end matches (IMO, 24hrs is not enough time to connect; tho, I guess, if people were serious, and had solid intentions, it might work) - lots of ghosting behaviour (not unique to this platform) - platform allows granular subscriptions...but totally nickel-and-dimes users In one word: meh.
