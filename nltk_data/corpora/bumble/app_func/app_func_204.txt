I want to give it more stars but I can't in it's current state. Other than the fake likes, it keeps swiping left when I'm scrolling down. This happens several times. Some of the features that were free before are now behind a pay wall. Given that most people are complaining about not getting matches to begin with, gives no incentive to pay for this app.
