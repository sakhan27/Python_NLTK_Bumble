Great concept, pretty fun to use. And then they started virtue signaling and banning photos with Firearms. Seriously? I swipe right for range day pics. My first connection on here was with a competitive target shooter. Stupid, stupid, stupid. Stay out of politics. You don't get responsible firearm ownership. Fine. Don't ban the girls who I'm actually interested in.
