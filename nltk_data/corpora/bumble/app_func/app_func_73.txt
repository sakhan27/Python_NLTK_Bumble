Well, you wanted a review, so here is my review. There's better apps out there. Plus, this company is Anti 2A (2nd Amendment). They bought into the idea that there's been a drastically increase of gun violence (you can find the stats on the FBI.gov page) They are taking down any picture with a gun (even toy guns, IE Nerf) because it "poses" a threat in their minds to the community While I know this is a silly thing to give a low star rating, I'll give my business else where that isn't anti Gun.
