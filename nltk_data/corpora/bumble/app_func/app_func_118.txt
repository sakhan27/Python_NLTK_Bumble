It is a cesspit of liberalism. You must specify vaccine status, mask status, and use pronouns like any useful idiot would. I'd say 90% of the profiles are boring liberal college girls and/or religious pretenders, often wearing almost nothing. Oh, and you're still shown men when you specify being straight. The UI looks/feels tacky and you're not allowed to show guns or anything they deem offensive (wheelies apparently), and it's pretty bad at recognizing faces. Making women talk first is BS too.
