Tinder with the gimmick that only women can initiate contact. Somewhat useful in the past, but they've now locked vital filters (namely religion) behind a steeper paywall than I've seen in almost any other dating app. I struggle to understand why any man would bother. EDIT: The daily subscription remains a poor value, especially given the paucity of matches I'm actually interested in following removal of advanced filter options. I obviously could scroll through each match, tediously rejecting each one that a basic filter would have previously prevented me from wasting my time looking at, slowly crushing my will to keep wading through the soul-sucking,depressing slough of the swipe left/right model you use. But the field of online dating is a crowded one. I'd rather spend my time (and money) on apps and services which aren't decreasing their usefulness in a transparent attempt to drive up subs. Bumble was deleted the day I made my intial review.
