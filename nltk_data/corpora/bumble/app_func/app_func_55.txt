Many dates but misleading because Bumble always says I have admirers but when I check (several times a day), there is no one to view, seriously! What kind of s..t is that when you done paid your money? Other than the guys playing you Bumble is, making you spend extra money to be noticed by paying for extra tokens or so-called better chances so that guy that you paid extra for to meet in the app. Also app says "You're offline", I have the fastest internet connection in my area. DO NOT install!
