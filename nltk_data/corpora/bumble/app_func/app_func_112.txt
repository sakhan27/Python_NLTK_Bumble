Notifications don't always work. Maybe that's why many matches expire, no notification of a match. People match and then don't even start a conversation (girls have to start it, as a guy I can't message first). I don't understand what's the point then. I understand it's a numbers game. Since it's [mostly]free, you're disposable at the next swipe.
