Had the app before and it was a good dating app. Redownload it and have come to realize bumble has taken the EA approach to business tactics. Why make good content for people when they can just lock everything behind a pay walls. When you finally get to use any part of the app it either doesn't work or freezes and forces to close. I finally got to use likes and I got like 5 of them then had to wait until the "next day." Time to delete and go back to random matches on Tinder..
