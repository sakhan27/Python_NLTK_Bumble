App recycles previously swiped profiles, giving the impression of more 
 choice. Few valuable filters. So much wasted time and energy. I find myself 
 less happy and more insecure since downloading this app. Matches often 
 never talk to you, or when they do, there are days between messages, even 
 if you were in the middle of a conversation, a conversation that they 
 started. App displays inactive profiles.
