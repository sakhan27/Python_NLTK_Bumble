After I had either matched or swiped left on the 33 initial likes I had it was like my profile stopped getting exposed. I'd get 1 like or so every couple days as if my profile was suddenly completely undesirable to everyone. I had a pretty consistent flow of matches when I used tinder... The ladies messaging first is a cool idea but usually they just message a simple "Hey" or "ðŸ‘‹" which gets old fast. I recommend downloading hinge for finding dates during the pandemic, it is 1000 times better!
