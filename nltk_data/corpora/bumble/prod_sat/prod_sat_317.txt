I've noticed the bad reviews I've found are guys... Let me tell you, as a woman using the BumbleBFF part of the app, I've had a great time. Growing up with a narcissisic mother, I was never good at making lady friends, and I'm too old to trust guy friends anymore when 99% of the time, guys just wanna bone. I've been on the app for a few days and I've already met a couple ladies who I've been talking to all day every day :) My only complaint is that I dont have enough room to write in my profile
