Dont waste your time! One worst apps!!! Only thing I liked is people are able verify profiles. Otherwise cant really make any matches and to see them you must subscribe which is not worth it either. They charged me upfront 6 months when I just wanted to pay monthly not all at once. Now I lost $80 with no matches so I deleted app just bad setup really get your money. Never downloading again as it deletes some matches after 24hrs if dont text of back like I'd be on app everyday to even check.
