I've been on (and off) Bumble for a year now, and in all seriousness I have to say that this is by far, the best dating app out there. I have met some really wonderful, intelligent, sophisticated and all around fun women from Bumble. Yes, I have also met some ignorant, and lame women as well, but thankfully those have been very minor experiences. Bumble has proven itself to be very valuable, and absolutely worth the time, and effort needed to make great connections. I highly recommend. 5 stars.
