The people who run this app kept moderating a photo of me, in a suit, holding up the Israeli and American flags at a Holocaust remembrance event... I guess that means being a proud Jewish American and honoring the victims of the Holocaust go against their community guidelines. Well done Bumble - you antisemitism scumbags. I'd give 0 stars if possible. Love getting the social justice message when I downloaded the app, only to have your team consider being Jewish a crime on your app.
