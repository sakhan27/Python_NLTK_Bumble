So I came here to write my first review because I'm frustrated. You all NEED to do something with the match que. It takes IMPOSSIBLY long to get through. I don't mind paying for premium, but the time it takes to even get through a few is ridiculous. The match que needs to be set up in the normal swipe fashion. It takes ages to get through, so when I finally do get to people, it's been so long their now married with 3 kids. PLEASE do something about this
