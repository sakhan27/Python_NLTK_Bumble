Quite possibly the most broken app on the market. After months of trying, 
 I'm still unable to link my account to Spotify. (Which is supposed to be a 
 main selling point) I'm not even able to change most of my personal 
 information, and worse, Bumble continues to force me to use their "basic" 
 info as mine. Not to mention Bumble has become a trap for people to boost 
 their Insta followers. If you pay into this app, you're wasting your money 
 and your time. Sadly Tinder is still better
