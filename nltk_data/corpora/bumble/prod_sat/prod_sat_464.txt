Update* I am now receiving messages, but when I click on the message, nothing is appearing. I can see the message preview of people who are messaging me, but can't read the whole thing. This app has become nothing more than a money grab. They recently have taken away features that were previously free from the beginning. I'm disgusted with this app.
