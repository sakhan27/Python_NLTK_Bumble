When this app 1st launched a few years ago it was okish. I would have given it a 3 star. Now however, it is impossible to get guys to chat to you. Maybe this is something to do with the paid for services that men need to sign up to to chat with women. If you don't mind older fellas with beards that you would never look twice at in the street, maybe this is the app for you. Very disappointed.
