This is just a tinder ripoff. Only difference is that guys don't get to say hi first. Too many fake accounts. It'll tell you that you get 10 likes a day but won't show you unless you fork over the cash. Then if you pay for the premium suddenly the "likes" stop. Just stick to the other apps, your not missing anything here.
