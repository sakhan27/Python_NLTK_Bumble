Great app but suddenly I was kicked off for not being 18 when I am in fact 18. Edit: I should be getting my account back soon now that it's been a while of them having my ID. I want to recommend to the developers that instead of just blocking and account you should also contact the person of that account. I was completely confused and I would of been less upset if I was contacted about being suspected under 18.
