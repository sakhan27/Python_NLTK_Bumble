The Bumble still uses fake accounts (with pictures of models) and bot matches to lure men to the app hoping they'll spend money. This app is fraudulent. Someone please file a class action lawsuit against this greedy, dishonest corporation! And Bumble Support, don't bother giving another cookie-cutter reply claiming you prohibit bots.
