Love the platform compared to other dating apps because it allows you to show off your actual personality through questions and not just a boring bio. The only gripe I have is when you match with someone, the female has to message first, which leads to a lot of disappointment. While there's a good motive behind it, it usually leads to all the matches expiring after 24 hours because they never say anything.
