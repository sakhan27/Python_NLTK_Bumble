Either bumble keeps glitching out and deleting conversations or I keep matching with arrogant, thoughtless men... Either way I've deleted my account because I'm tired of having perfectly pleasant conversations and then have someone disappear for seemingly no reason. The one positive about this app is if the other person fills out most of the information you can potentially get a good idea of what the other person is like... If they're honest.
