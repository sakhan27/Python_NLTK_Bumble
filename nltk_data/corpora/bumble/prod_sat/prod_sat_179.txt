Totally unacceptable. 3 out of 5 conversations have just disappeared overnight. I don't like the concept of the 24 hour deadline, most annoying. And what's the point in showing me people who just happen to be in the neighborhood but live at the other end of the country? I'm not keen on broadcasting my location all the time anyway.
