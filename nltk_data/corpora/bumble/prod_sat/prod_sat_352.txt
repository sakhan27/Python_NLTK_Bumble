My experience in Los Angeles was not great. It seemed like women were using 
 the app as an ego booster rather than a dating app. I now live about an 
 hour south of DC. I see the best quality women on Bumble and they are 
 actually willing to meet... Same issues as other dating apps include people 
 misrepresenting themselves with old pictures. That's life. I only need to 
 meet the right one.
