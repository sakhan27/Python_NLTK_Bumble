While I respect the philosophy and approach for women to initiate conversations, it's extremely difficult to match and actually, you know, connect in any way with anyone on the app, defeating the entire purpose of using it. It's obvious that it's a business model to get users to purchase in app upgrades. Sadly it just feels like you are going to spend hours swiping left or right and maybe get a single match who then doesn't speak to you. If I'm going to spend that sort of time meeting someone, maybe I should just leave my house and go into the real world
