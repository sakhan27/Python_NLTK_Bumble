People are nice here. I'm happy there is a dating and bff side. Some problems: I wrote out a dating bio, then flipped to bff and my bio was no longer appropriate. I changed it for BFFs. Now the men see my bff profile only. Problem. If I toggle it, I have to keep rewriting. Also, there was a glitch. I toggled to bff, swiped, and then I checked it again and it had switched to women O_O Now I doubt all my swipes. (I'm straight.)
