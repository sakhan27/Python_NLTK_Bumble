Bunch of fake accounts and by that I mean a lot. Bff feature is nice and 
 that deserves 1 star. I downloaded the app long time ago and disabled my 
 account at the same day cuz I didn't want to have more than one dating app. 
 Tho They did warn me that this step will cost me to lose priority if I 
 reactivate my account again so that's maybe why.
