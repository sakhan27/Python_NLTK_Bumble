Edit: After some thinking, I finally gave in and decided to purchase a subscription. Needless to say, I was impressed. Unlike Tinder, Bumble allows you to learn more about people, and to react to their images more diversely. In addition, I've had an easier time, as a guy, engaging in conversations with matches. My subscription is still in effect so I can't say whether or not it's good without it, but so far, my experience with bumble has been collectively better than every dating app I've tried.
