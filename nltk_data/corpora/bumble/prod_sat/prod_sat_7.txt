Bumble is a humbling reminder of how shallow the online dating world has become. With god knows how many matches, it's hard enough on Tinder or similar dating apps to catch a girl's eye with a witty intro or suave pickup line but when you make it so the women have to message first only the most attractive ever get messaged, leaving us average looking blokes to get sidelined and ignored. Decent concept, terrible implementation. If your goal was to avoid dick-pics and grotesque first messages, allow the guy only one message to start a convo or something and then have the match expire within 24hrs
