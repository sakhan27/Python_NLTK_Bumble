Get notification saying I have matches. I then go into app and heart in top left corner states I have 10 matches? I go to my beeline and there are 0 matches. I go back to main page and still says I have matches, so I go back to beeline and 0 matches. After logging out/in and trying several things, the heart now shows no matches and no matches in beeline. I had paid for the premium service and this is the result.
