Having the girl message first isn't a bad idea; however, most of you matches will match for no reason and let the match expire. I am a decent looking guy with a lot of personality traits and yet I have only had about 7-15 matches on bumble while using it for almost a year and maybe 3 of those matches actually sent a message. In comparison, I had over 14 matches on Tinder in about 4 hours one time, and half of those girls responded. So I think bumble should reconsider its algorithm.
