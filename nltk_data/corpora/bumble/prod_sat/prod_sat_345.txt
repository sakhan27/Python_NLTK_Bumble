I thought this would be a great app seeing how it is friendly for women users, however when a guy matches with me and I go to check out my "hive" it won't let me do anything without paying. I'm not going to pay over $10 a month. That is bullshit. You have a great concept that I was looking forward to after hearing about it from other girls, but I was very disappointed that you are forcing people to pay to use this app.
