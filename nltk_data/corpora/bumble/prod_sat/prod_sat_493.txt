This app is trash, it's full of shallow misandrists. I've had multiple matches with girls and have yet to even be given the courtesy of a brief conversation. They all just let the timer run out while they search for a hotter guy. I think if you match with someone you should at least have the opportunity to initiate a conversation. This app is clearly the fever dream of some dyke who thinks women will actually message men first without incentive.
