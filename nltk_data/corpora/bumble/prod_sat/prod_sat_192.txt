The app is nothing more than a scam . They cancel memberships for no apparent reason right after paying. I'm just glad I only purchase one week or I would have been scammed for a lot more. Whoever runs this app must be from Nigeria or Ghana. To the person claiming they want to "personally review what happened with me". I do not use Facebook or Twitter because these web-sites are run by Jewish mobsters who collect and sell the personal information of their users without their authorization. It does not surprise me at all that you expect me to use those corrupt web-sites. The bottom line is you ripped me off and I intend to expose you for your corruption all over YouTube.
