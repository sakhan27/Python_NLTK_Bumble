Can't understand why I am getting no matches at all. A little over a year 
 ago this was like tinder for matches and I went on 7 dates in 7 nights just 
 through this! Either the extremely good looking and immensely charming men 
 have come out of the woodwork and I'm being totally overlooked or there is 
 something not right with this app!!
