Very frustrating that I lost my phone on which bumble was working fine. 
 Trying to install on my old HTC one mini 2 but it won't get to my account. 
 I have to login via Facebook but get the something went wrong message every 
 time. I'm mid conversations on my lost phone...they'll think I'm rude 
 ignoring them.
