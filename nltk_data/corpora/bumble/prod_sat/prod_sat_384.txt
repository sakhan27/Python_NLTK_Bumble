It sounds like everyone is having the same problem of getting no matches. Tons of very attractive women on here but good luck getting a match with them no matter how attractive you are. I've tried Bumble in the past and I got plenty of matches, this last time nothing. Something is wrong with the app and they need to fix it. Apparently from their replies they don't think anything is wrong though. So nothing is going to change. Too bad, I really liked the concept of this app. Don't waist your time on it!
