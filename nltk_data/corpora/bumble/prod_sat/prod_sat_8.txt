I love the concept of bumble, BUT I still feel like it is in the man's hands as far as starting up a conversation. I say this because if I have a match, I will start a conversation and most of the time I never get a response back. I did my part but it is still up to them to return the message. This app became way to frustrating for me. Would rarely get matches and if I did they either deleted it (why swipe right in the first place) or they would never respond back.
