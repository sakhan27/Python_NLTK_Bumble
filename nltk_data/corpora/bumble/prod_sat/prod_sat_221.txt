In several years of using this, I don't think I've ever met a single person in real life. People seem to unmatch right after I reach out with a friendly greeting. In comparison, I've met several people over the same time frame on Bumble's competitors, which also happen to not require I waste my time responding first without an option to let others message me first. So perhaps Bumble's “women have to message first, no exceptions” system may not be that great, after all.
