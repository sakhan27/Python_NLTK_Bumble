However this app's matching algorithm works, it's really weird. I'm not particularly picky about my swipes (although all the educated beautiful people are put at the front of the stack when swiping), and get matches with really attractive women but it only happens once in a blue moon. Even if you've got a good profile that attracts people on other apps like Tinder, OKC or POF, this app seems to so rarely produce anything fruitful that it feels like a waste of time to be on it. I think the concept has a lot of potential and the matches I have gotten have been interesting, it's just die exceedingly rare that it feels like unless you get lucky enough to be on the front of people's stacks all the time that it's just a waste to be on this app much.
