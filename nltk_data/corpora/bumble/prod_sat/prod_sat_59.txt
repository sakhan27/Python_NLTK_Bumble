Let me tell you how this works. When you first create an account, all the likes you get WILL NOT show up on your swipes for at least 24 hours or until you've exhausted all your free swipes. Only then will they began to show up. Clearly to get you to pay and try hiding what they're doing. EDIT: Now I'm banned and they won't reply to answer why. Lol terrible company. Don't support them.
