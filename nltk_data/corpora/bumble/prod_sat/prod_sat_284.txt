saw a lot of ads about this app and would like to try the bff mode of it or the bizz but hey turns out it wont work even if I chose the date mode. Last night I thought it was just my weak mobile data but when I got a strong wifi connection it wont still load. Its just a waste of time if it aint got fixed asap.
