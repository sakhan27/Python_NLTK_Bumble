Update: your reply is useless. I didn't ask for an explanation. I asked you to stop bothering me with this (or any) intercept that I am not going to participate in. /OG: WTH is with this "pick a charity" nonsense. I don't support any of those groups so let me bypass your annoying popup. I don't need you creating donations from my user activity. Focus on your primary business model and leave me alone otherwise.
