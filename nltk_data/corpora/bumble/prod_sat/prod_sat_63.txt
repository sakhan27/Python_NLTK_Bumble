I want to believe this app is on the level, but ultimately it's not. there are lots of bot accounts that "like" you back. and you get a message that reads "hi there", and nothing ever again. this has happened multiple times now. along with emails stating "someone likes you!" and when you go to the app , theres nothing. just another pay to play romance game on your phone. not worth the energy...
