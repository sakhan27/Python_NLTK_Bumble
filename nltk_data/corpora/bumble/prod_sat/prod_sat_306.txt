I gave two stars rather than one as I enjoyed this app when I last used it. However, I am unable to get past "swipe right to start". I have only seen this mentioned on other Google play reviews. No matter what I do, the initial "swipe right" won't leave. This is a basic flaw of design. I can't even judge current Bumble on how well it does it's role because I can't even get to that aspect of it.
