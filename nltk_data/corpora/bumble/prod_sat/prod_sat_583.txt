Just another app to make (hetero)men lose confidence. The women gets to make the first move which at first seemed ok but the more I used the app and getting no likes, the more I ask, "what do women want?" It seems the algorithm is pretty bad or on purpose. This app feels fake and the developers seem only interested in money. Why do I have to pay just to use the filters? Come on!!! It's already difficult for us guys! I got more matches on other apps. My confidence at finding Bumble match : 0/10.
