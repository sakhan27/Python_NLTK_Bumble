Idea is good on paper, but I encountered a lot of duplicate accounts, and accounts that SAID they were in my vicinity even though info said they now live out of state. Also there is no restriction so that you can only be seen by people in your area. As I had multiple likes from people out of state. Only reason I am giving it two instead of one is because it's clear it works.
