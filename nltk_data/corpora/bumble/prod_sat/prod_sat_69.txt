When I first got the app, I was getting matched and talking to people left and right. After a week or so, a lot of that died off, I'm only getting a match every few days, and the few good conversations I was having just dropped off. Sometimes, if I restart my phone, new messages and matches come through, so I have no clue what's happening. My app is up to date and nothing appears to be wrong with my phone. It's just frustrating when you think something good is going, but then everything just drops off and you can't tell if it's just because they don't want to talk anymore or if maybe they aren't getting the messages right when you send them, like an algorithm is keeping you from speaking.
