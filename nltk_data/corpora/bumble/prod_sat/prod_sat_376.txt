App was doing great and then one day it placed me back to the login screen. Tried to log back in and hit to reset my password but always gave me an error. No big deal but I emailed tech support about this issue weeks ago and never heard back from them. Only thing i get as far as email from Bumble is spam. This is my point on moving to a better dating app if they can't even fix a minor issue. Other problem is, my account is probably still active and I can't even get in to disable it
