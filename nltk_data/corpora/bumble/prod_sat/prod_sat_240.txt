Bumble ended up tailoring my "matches" by analyzing my swipes. I only swiped right for men that had something particular in there About Me section. And Bumble picked that up and began to offer more profiles with that. Thanks Bumble! The app is super easy to use, build your acct through your Facebook. It's fun, some people are actually looking for real relationships which I appreciate! It has potential to get better. I would like to see more push for the About Me section so it's not so shallow. Great app!
