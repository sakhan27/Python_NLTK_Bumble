Updated review (Legal steps taken): I requested my data through a Subject Access Request, and provided my proof of identity with other key account information. I initially spoke to Joel from Bumble, but It's now been more than 30 days and I haven't had a response from Bumble, Joel, and have still not received my data. I have now reported Bumble to the ICO, and have instructed my solicitor to file litigation. Bumble is going to court! Read the news soon.
