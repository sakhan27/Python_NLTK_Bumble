This app makes you feel like its kinda hopless to find that person you want. I feel like even though you have to wait for the girl message you it doesn't happen and most of the time I feel they only swiped just to mess with you. I don't doubt people actually got relationships from this app but I feel like I tried to hard for something I can't achieve from this.
