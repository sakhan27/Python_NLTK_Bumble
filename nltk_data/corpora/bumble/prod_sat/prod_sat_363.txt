Either the girls who downloaded this don't use it, they're fake profiles of Facebook users used to populate an empty app, or they're a thousand times pickier on this than they are on other similar apps which makes this worthless. Perhaps because they're the ones who have to start the conversation, girls are being supremely choosy and only want to start a chat with the absolute top tier of guys. I've got more matches on tinder than I know what to do with, but as of right now this app is a pure waste of time
