Bit the bullet and paid the $10 to actually see the people who matched with me, the app then told me I hadn't paid and needed me to pay again even though I have the emailed receipt. Put in multiple support tickets asking for help and received none nor can I even ask for a refund. Moving on to a different app or trying Tinder again.
