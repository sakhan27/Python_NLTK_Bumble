I purchased in app subscription boost. I can't see who Swiped/ matches me. (I'm the only one who can swipe). I can't message anyone. I paid R209 for nothing. I want a refund. It works the exact same as before i made a purchase. This is unfair. I didnt get what was advertised. I would love a refund. It keep saying I must purchase premium to see??? Then why advertise boost if premium is the only one that allows you to actually chat to people. This app I can't use for free. Disappointing
