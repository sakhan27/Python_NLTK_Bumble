Worst Experience so far, I installed the app 3 weeks ago and after going through couple of profiles I realized its just another version of Tinder .We were doing a Short Documentary film on online dating and I wantedbto gather as much as information possible and for that I had to subscribe for premium membership and that was the wprst mistake. I canceled the membership within first week of subscription and now its been 3 weeks and am getting charged every week. Stay away its a scam.
