I've had more accounts blocked on here for literally no reason than I've had matches lol such a joke app. Oh look the generic reply from them. No, they are lying they don't investigate ban, I've had over ten accounts banned for literally no reason and I've kept proof of it for a lawsuit I filed against them. Hey support, I've contacted you via email, Facebook, and Twitter over 20 times in the last year with no response. You are a joke company. June update - emailed another 5 times, nothing.
