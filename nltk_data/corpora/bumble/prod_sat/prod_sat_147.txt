Not worth the time it takes to download. Complete waste of time! The women pictured are not the women who actually use the app. For example, you'll swipe 10-15 beautiful, seemingly flawless women (10s), and 3 that 6s. The 6s are the only ones who will swipe right. I easily go 6 months with no matches, then if I get a match, she lets the match expire before sending a message. Don't fall for it. Bumble sucks!
