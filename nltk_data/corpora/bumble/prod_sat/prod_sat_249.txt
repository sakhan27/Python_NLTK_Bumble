Im just starting this account and I have to say not being able to see who wants to meet you is annoying they should've at least gave you 3 days free to look at your matches, you can't even message them. It's kind of crappy that the notification only last one day at least give you a week for the notification to disappear. Alot of people tell me this is the best site around but this is just sad, People of Bumble if you are reading this you need to do better!.
