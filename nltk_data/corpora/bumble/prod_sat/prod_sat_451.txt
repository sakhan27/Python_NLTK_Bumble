The idea is good and pretty well 60-70% of the girls here are gorgeous, but I haven't had a single match. I don't know if it's because I'm ugly or if these girls aren't on the app anymore. It just wasn't fun not getting matches. If I had to critique the app not based on getting matches, I'd say it's a good concept and to give it a shot
