If you download the app please don't bother paying for the premium as I have, the travel mode which it offers doesn't work as it should and you won't get any match. You might see matches in the city you change it to but I doubt if they show your profile to them. The superwipe is a waste also. It is better to use the free account. I regret paying for a premium subscription
