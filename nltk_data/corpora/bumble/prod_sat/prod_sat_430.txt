Your apps forced control over my profile can only described in two words 'very annoying' I have added a few pictures of myself in my profile in the BFF section, and yet your app keeps forcing me to go back to the page where I need to upload a picture, even when I take a new picture on the spot, it still forcefully redirects me again to the page... I had to delete and reinstall the app again just so that i could finally access the dating section again and even in that section, I have no control
