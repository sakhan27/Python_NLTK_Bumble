Pretty empty, lotsa advertising accounts Within day I went through all the people within my area, most accounts I've seen are just self promoting snapchat, instagram, or only fans. Of my few matches almost none messaged within 24hr window and thus were automatically unmatched. Pretty sad excuse for a dating app.
