Seems real, I'm sure women appreciate being in control of who chats first. Haven't 'won' and did spend some cash ($20ish), might be too easy and the women to just be passing through and not care. Is a little fishy all/most women have really well shot photos. Not spending my life on these platforms, not sure if normal. A real study to find out how much are not real humans would be helpful.
