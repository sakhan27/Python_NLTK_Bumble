I turned my date mode off, but people are still able to see my date profile when they should not be able to. I know this because I am still getting matches with people from date mode. I have contacted bumble multiple times to get this fixed, but each time I get an automated response that has nothing to do with what I'm asking. They're extremely unhelpful and don't care about any problems with the app. Also, you get a very limited (like 30) number of likes per day or something.
