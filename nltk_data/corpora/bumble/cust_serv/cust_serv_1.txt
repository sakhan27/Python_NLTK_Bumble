I tried purchasing the premium and it comes up with a error message saying the other payment haven't been approved, I've checked with my bank (no payments pending from Bumble or on hold) uninstalled the app, cleared cookies. Nothing works and I cannot change the payment method. Contacted the support 2 weeks ago to this day didn't hear anything from them. App good -> customer support bad.
