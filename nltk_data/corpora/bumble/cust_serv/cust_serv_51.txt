Why do only men have to pay and the woman don't.. I did reach out to your support team and no one got back to me. I made a super swipe by accident when I meant to do a regular swipe so I asked for refund because I didn't want to super swipe anymore and no one ever got back to me so I unlinked my card so this won't happen again. The star button and swipe are to close together
