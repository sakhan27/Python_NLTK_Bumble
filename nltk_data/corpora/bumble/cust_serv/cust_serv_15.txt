**Terrible Security** It's 2021, this app doesn't allow me to update my contact details?!!?? Nonsense standard-reply that doesn't aim to resolve issue from support team. And worse off, no response from subsequent emails i sent to ask for further clarity. Since you havent develop the feature to update contact in app, then you can easily do it manually backend, isnt it? Instead you are just ignore me. Someone steal my phone number and my account but you're not helping to prevent frauds.
