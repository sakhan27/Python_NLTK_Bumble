Someone hacked into my account. I Informed bumble and then got banned for rude messages. Which not from me and from the hacker instead. But they can't show me my own conversation and I had no way to prove it wasn't me so got my account banned when they full knew i was hacked. They could see my number was changed and didn't care so I'm sure they not care about you either.
