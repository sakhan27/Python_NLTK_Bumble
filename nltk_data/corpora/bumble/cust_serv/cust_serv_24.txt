Scam.. tried to cancel 3 days after I signed up. Fake... I'm still being 
 charged a month after I cancelled. No return emails, cancelled 1 time in 
 July and 2 times in August. Now I search on Google and see this is basic 
 business practice for Google Bumble. A good class action lawsuit should fix 
 that! Until then, I'll cancel my credit card and dispute August charges.
